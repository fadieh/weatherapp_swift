#WeatherApp

Unfortunately, I am rather bad at judging the weather when I have started my day and am deciding upon how many layers I should be wearing to keep me comfortable. Fortunately, as the saying goes; there is now an app for that. As a work in progress, I'm aiming for the app to use the current temperature, wind and humidity levels to determine how you should wrap up.
