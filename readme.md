#WeatherApp

Unfortunately, I am rather bad at judging the weather and the clothes I should wear to go with it. Fortunately, as the saying goes; there is now an app for that. As a work in progress, I'm aiming for the app to use the current temperature, wind and humidity levels to determine how you should wrap up.
